The goal of this project is to build an intelligent job referral system that automatically crawls internal job postings, uses a large language model to analyze and classify job content, and stores the results in a relational database. Users can interact with a Streamlit-based UI to receive personalized job recommendations through keyword search or semantic matching powered by LLM embeddings.
